### CPSC 120

Introduction to Basic Syntax Lab 1:
This lab focused on the foundational syntax of C++ and was my favorite because it set a strong groundwork for programming logic. I liked how it systematically explained variables, loops, and conditionals through hands-on examples. From this lab, I learned how to write clean, well-structured code and gained confidence in debugging simple errors.

Lab 4: Working with Functions
The lab on functions stood out because it let me learn about modular programming. I enjoyed seeing how breaking down code into reusable blocks improved clarity and efficiency. Through this lab, I not only mastered creating and using functions but also understood the importance of parameter passing and return values in making programs versatile.

Lab 7: Introduction to Makefiles
It also built upon prior knowledge, introducing the make command that helped in compiling source code with much ease. I particularly enjoyed how it showed the application of the Makefile to manage and keep track of larger projects. I took away from this lab the way one could automate repetitive tasks and, further, how efficient it made compiling multiple files with dependencies.
